How to sign people in:
 - scan their ID while the text box is focused
 - type their name/ID into the text box and hit "Sign In"/Enter
 - Click "View Unaccounted-for Staff Members", find their name, and click it
   - You can then mark them as on a day off, as on shmira, or as signing in normally
   
If you would like to save the current data, click the "Save" button.
If you are done for the night (i.e. everyone has signed in, or you want to mark everyone who hasn't signed in as being absent), click "Save and Return to Setup".

**IMPORTANT: DO NOT HAVE THE ATTENDANCE FILE OPEN IN EXCEL WHEN YOU CLICK "Save" OR "Save and Return to Setup"! THE SAVE WILL FAIL, THE FILE MAY BECOME CORRUPTED, AND YOU ARE LIKELY TO LOSE DATA **
